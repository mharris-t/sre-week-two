## Introduction
This is the repository for the SRE Fundamentals with Google Course's Week 2 Project. 

## Initializing Environment (in GitHub Codepace)
Initialize the environment by running ```Ã¬nit_env.sh``` script. Once the pods are up and running, run the ```run-services.sh``` script to forward ports in the Minikube cluster. 

### Note:
If you are running this in an environment other than GitHub Codespace, ensure [Minikube and Docker are installed in the system](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/drivers/docker/).
